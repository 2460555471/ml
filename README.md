##Introduction

This package implement classic machine learning algorithms. Motivations for this project includes:

1. Help machine learning freshman to have a better and deeper understanding of the basic algorithms and model in this field.
2. Provide the `battery-included` code and data for ML prototyping.

Following algorithms and models will be implemented in this package. 
For some of them, `NumPy` support is necessary.
Ensure to configure `NumPy` with advanced linear algebra implementations(`BLAS`, `ATLAS`, `Lapack`). 
The default implementation is extremely slow.

##Naive Bayes

nb.py implements Naive Bayes(NB) classifier for both `Multi-variate Bernoulli` and `Multinomial` event model.

Run `python nb.py` to train and test NB on `20 Newsgroups` dataset.

By default, train and test data are generated by randomly split the benchmark dataset with an approximate ratio of `4:1`.

Accuracy for `Multi-variate Bernoulli` event model: `78.842676%`

Accuracy for `Multinomial` event model: `84.674503%`

NB is a generative model, different event model leads to different assumption on the distribution of p(x | y).

For example, in spam classification, 
after we decided to generate a spam or non-spam text according to the class prior p(y), 
we need to further decide which words to be included in the text, we can:

1. Go through the whole dictionary, for each word, toss a coin to decide whether to append the word to the text.
2. Randomly select words from the dictionary.

In the first way, each word is drawn from a Bernoulli distribution, 
and the text is generated by the `Multi-variate Bernoulli` event model.

In the second way, all words are drawn from a `Multinomial` distribution.

TODO: Parallel NB classifier implementation.

##Matrix Factorization

recsys/mf.py implements matrix factorization(MF) algorithms for recommendation.

Run `python mf.py` to train and test MF on the `1 million` version of the `MovieLens` dataset.

RMSE on the test data is `0.932806` after `5 iterations`.
