##Introduction

This package implement classic machine learning algorithms. Motivations for this project includes:

1. Help machine learning freshman to have a better and deeper understanding of the basic algorithms and model in this field.
2. Provide the battery-included code and data for ML prototyping.

Following algorithms and models will be implemented in this package. 
For some of them, `NumPy` support and necessary.
Please ensure to configure `NumPy` with advanced implementations of basic linear algebra(BLAS, ATLAS, LAPACK). 
The default implementation is extremely slow.

1. Naive Bayes
2. Decision Tree
3. Perceptron
4. Linear Regression
5. Logistic Regression
6. Support Vector Machines
7. AdaBoost
8. Matrix Factorization
9. Nerual Network
10. Optimization
