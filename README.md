##Introduction

This package implement classic machine learning algorithms. Motivations for this project includes:

1. Help machine learning freshman to have a better and deeper understanding of the basic algorithms and model in this field.
2. Provide the battery-included code and data for ML prototyping.

Following algorithms and models will be implemented in this package. 
For some of them, `NumPy` support is necessary.
Ensure to configure `NumPy` with advanced linear algebra implementations(`BLAS`, `ATLAS`, `Lapack`). 
The default implementation is extremely slow.

1. Naive Bayes
2. Decision Tree
3. Perceptron
4. Linear Regression
5. Logistic Regression
6. Support Vector Machines
7. AdaBoost
8. Matrix Factorization
9. Nerual Network
10. Optimization

##Matrix Factorization

recsys/mf.py implements matrix factorization algorithms for recommendation.

Type `python mf.py` to run this demo using `ml-1m/ratings.dat.train` as training data, and `ml-1m/ratings.data.test` for test.

The training and test data are generated by randomly split the `1 million` version of the `MovieLens` dataset with an approximate ratio of `4:1`.

RMSE on the test data is `0.932806` after `5 iterations`.
